# TrustLens Roadmap

> Last updated: September 2026
> This roadmap reflects our current priorities. Community feedback shapes every phase.

---

## Current State (v0.5.0)

- ✅ Stable ML evaluation pipeline (calibration, failure, bias, representation)
- ✅ Head-to-head model comparison API (`trustlens.compare`)
- ✅ Decision-ready Trust Score (methodology 2.0: sub-scores, blockers and caps; see ADR-001)
- ✅ Framework-agnostic prediction resolver architecture (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
- ✅ Scientific Validation: Model Zoo Benchmark for accuracy/trust decoupling
- ✅ Professional contributor infrastructure and documentation

---

## Status Legend

- [x] Completed (production-ready)
- [~] In progress / Experimental (limited availability)
- [ ] Planned

---

## Active Work (v0.6.0)

These are high-priority items currently being developed or targeted for the next release.

- [ ] **Policy Profiles** (Issue #56) — *Context-aware scoring (Strict/Lenient)*
- [ ] **TrustComparison** (Issue #57) — *Differential reliability audits*
- [x] **XGBoost Support** — *Native prediction resolver architecture*
- [x] **Model Zoo Benchmark** — *Scientific validation of trust diagnostics*
- [ ] **Deep Learning Backends** — *Keras & TensorFlow resolvers (framework detection exists; no resolver yet — pass `y_prob` manually)*
- [~] **HTML Report Export** (Issue #19) — *[OPEN]*
- [x] **Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)** (Issue #1)

---

## Phase 1: MVP — *The Foundation*

**Status: COMPLETE**

The minimal set of features required to be genuinely useful to practitioners.

### Deliverables
- [x] Core `analyze()` API with module dispatch
- [x] `TrustReport` result container with `show()`, `plot()`, `save()`
- [x] **Calibration**: Brier Score, ECE, reliability curve + reliability diagram
- [x] **Failure Analysis**: misclassification summary, confidence gap histogram
- [x] **Bias Detection**: class imbalance report, subgroup accuracy/F1
- [x] **Representation Analysis**: silhouette separability, CKA metric
- [~] **Explainability**: Grad-CAM with PyTorch support — *[EXPERIMENTAL]*
- [~] **Faithfulness**: pixel deletion + insertion tests (AUPC) — *[EXPERIMENTAL]*
- [x] Plugin system (BasePlugin + PluginRegistry)
- [x] Full test suite (>230 tests)
- [x] Professional README, CONTRIBUTING, quickstart examples
- [x] PyPI package & GitHub Actions CI (lint/test/format)

---

## Phase 2: Core Expansion — *Going Deeper*

**Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE** — checked items shipped (most in v0.5.0); unchecked items are still open.

> **Focus:** High-impact ML features that integrate directly into the `analyze()` pipeline.

### High Priority
- [x] **Equalized Odds** (Issue #25)
- [x] **UMAP/t-SNE Visualization** (Issue #22)
- [x] **Jupyter Rich Display** (`_repr_html_`) (Issue #24)
- [ ] **Progress Bars** via `tqdm` (Issue #28) — *implemented earlier, removed together with the tqdm dependency; not currently available*
- [ ] **Subgroup ECE** (calibration per demographic group) — *not implemented yet*
- [~] **HTML Report Export** (Issue #19) — [OPEN]
- [ ] **Temperature Scaling** (Issue #18)
- [x] **Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)** (Issue #1)

### Nice to Have
- [ ] **Multi-class ECE** (label-wise decomposition)
- [ ] **Critical Failures** table for `TrustReport`
- [ ] **Per-class PR curves** and optimal threshold analysis
- [ ] **Prediction Flip Analysis** (robustness check)
- [ ] **Eigen-CAM** (gradient-free explainability)
- [ ] **Integrated Gradients (IG)** for tabular models
- [ ] **SHAP Wrapper** (optional dependency)
- [ ] **Text-based Sensitive Feature Parsing**
- [ ] **Linear Probing** accuracy per layer
- [ ] **Intrinsic Dimensionality** estimation for embeddings

### Framework Support
- [x] **XGBoost Integration** — Native `analyze()` support for `XGBClassifier` and raw `Booster`
- [x] **LightGBM Integration** — Native `analyze()` support for `LGBMClassifier` and raw `Booster`
- [x] **CatBoost Integration** — Native `analyze()` support for `CatBoostClassifier`
- [ ] **Keras** — Sequential and functional model support (no resolver yet)
- [ ] **TensorFlow** — SavedModel loading and lazy import hygiene (no resolver yet)

---

## Phase 3: Comparative & Research — *Frontier Methods*

**Target: v0.5.x**

Methods primarily of interest to ML researchers pushing state-of-the-art and production diffing.

### Comparative Audits
- [x] **Model recommendation engine** (`trustlens.compare`)
- [x] **Score comparison tables**
- [ ] **Policy-aware deltas** (Issue #57)

### Advanced Representation
- [ ] Layer-wise CKA heatmap (n_layers × n_layers)
- [ ] Neuron activation statistics per class
- [ ] Representation fragility score (adversarial perturbation)

### Benchmarking
- [ ] `benchmark()` function — run TrustLens on standard datasets (CIFAR-10, etc.)
- [ ] Baseline scores for common architectures

---

## Phase 4: Community Growth — *Scaling Impact*

**Target: v0.5.0**

Making TrustLens a community standard.

### Contribution & Documentation
- [x] Contributor hall of fame in README
- [ ] Video walkthrough series
- [~] Interactive Jupyter notebooks (in `examples/`; Colab badges not added yet)
- [ ] Plugin submission process (community plugin registry)
- [ ] `trustlens-contrib` companion repository

### Integrations
- [ ] **MLflow**: log TrustLens metrics as experiment artifacts
- [ ] **Weights & Biases**: log reliability diagrams as charts
- [ ] **Hugging Face**: `evaluate`-compatible metric modules
- [ ] **DVC**: TrustLens report as a DVC stage output

---

## Phase 5: Platform — *The Full Stack*

**Target: v1.0.0**

TrustLens as a complete model analysis platform.

### Web Dashboard
- [ ] Zero-config web UI (`trustlens serve`) using FastAPI + React
- [ ] Interactive reliability diagrams (Plotly)
- [ ] Model comparison views

### Enterprise Features
- [ ] Scheduled monitoring reports (model drift detection)
- [ ] Slack/Teams alerting on metric regression
- [ ] Role-based access for team reports
