# Regression Metrics

Regression metrics evaluate the accuracy and reliability of continuous target predictions, particularly focusing on the quality of the model's uncertainty bounds.

## Why This Matters

For regression tasks, a point prediction is rarely enough for high-stakes decision-making. Teams need to know both *how close* the prediction is on average (Skill) and *how reliable* the uncertainty bounds are (Interval Calibration). Over-confident intervals that routinely miss the target can lead to disastrous downstream decisions.

## When to Use

- when evaluating any regression or continuous-target model
- when validating the reliability of prediction intervals (e.g., confidence intervals or quantiles)
- when you need to understand if a model's uncertainty bounds actually correlate with its errors

## Core Concepts

TrustLens evaluates regression models across three primary dimensions:

### 1. Accuracy and Skill
Measures the overall fit of the model's point predictions against the ground truth.
*   **RMSE & MSE:** Standard distance metrics measuring average error.
*   **Skill Score (R²):** The coefficient of determination against a predict-the-mean baseline (`1 - MSE/Var(y)`). It provides a scale-free measure of how much better the model is than simply guessing the average value.
*   **Heavy-Tail Penalty:** TrustLens automatically analyzes the error distribution (e.g., the ratio of the p90 error to the median error) to identify and penalize models that hide catastrophic misses behind an acceptable average error.

### 2. Interval Calibration
Checks whether the predicted uncertainty intervals are honest.
*   **Single-Level PICP:** For a single prediction interval (e.g., a 90% confidence interval), TrustLens calculates the Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and its associated `calibration_error`.
*   **Multi-Level Interval Calibration Error (ICE):** When multi-level intervals are provided, TrustLens calculates ICE, which is the mean absolute coverage gap across all supplied levels (`mean |emp(tau) - tau|`). This is the regression equivalent of Expected Calibration Error (ECE) for classification.

### 3. Uncertainty Informativeness
Evaluates whether the uncertainty bounds are actually useful. A model can be perfectly calibrated by predicting the marginal distribution every time, but this provides no discriminative value.
*   **Calibration-Conditioned Sharpness Proxy:** Evaluates how much tighter the model's intervals are compared to a naive climatology baseline (`1 - weighted_mean(model_width / climatology_width)`). Each level is weighted by its calibration: weight 1 within the tolerance (`|emp - tau| <= 0.05`), falling linearly to 0 at twice the tolerance. Over-confident, artificially narrow intervals are excluded and cannot inflate this score, and a level drifting across the tolerance changes the proxy gradually. The Uncertainty Informativeness sub-score is additionally scaled by the best level's weight (`sharpness_weight`), so it falls continuously to 0 as the last usable level becomes miscalibrated.
*   **Error-Variance Correlation:** A fallback metric that calculates the Spearman/Pearson correlation between the predicted variance and the realized absolute error.
