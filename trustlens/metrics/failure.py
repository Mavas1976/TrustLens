    """
    Measure the *confidence gap* — how much more confident is the model
    on correct predictions than on incorrect ones?

    What it measures
    ----------------
    The difference in mean confidence between correct and incorrect predictions.

    Why it matters
    --------------
    A model should "know what it doesn't know." High confidence on incorrect predictions
    (low gap) is a major deployment risk.

    Limitations
    -----------
    Does not capture the full distribution shape, only the means.

    Interpretation guidance
    -----------------------
    Higher gap is better. A large positive gap indicates the model lowers its confidence
    when making mistakes. If the model is 100% correct or 0% correct (one of the comparison
    groups is empty), the gap is defined as 0.0.

    Returns
    -------
    dict with keys:
      * ``correct_confidence``  — confidence distribution for correct preds
      * ``incorrect_confidence`` — confidence distribution for incorrect preds
      * ``gap``         — mean(correct_conf) - mean(incorrect_conf)
      * ``histogram_bins``    — bin edges for the confidence histogram
      * ``correct_hist``     — histogram counts for correct predictions
      * ``incorrect_hist``    — histogram counts for incorrect predictions

) -> Optional[float]:
    """
    AUROC of top-label confidence for separating correct from wrong predictions.

    What it measures
    ----------------
    The probability that a randomly chosen correct prediction has a higher
    confidence than a randomly chosen wrong one. 1.0 means confidence ranks
    every error below every correct prediction; 0.5 means confidence carries no
    information about errors.

    Why it matters
    --------------
    Unlike the mean confidence gap, AUROC is scale-free: its attainable range
    does not shrink with the number of classes or with accuracy, so a
    well-calibrated, accurate model is not penalised (ADR-001, TL-01).

    Returns
    -------
    float or None
      AUROC in [0, 1], or ``None`` when all predictions are correct or all are
